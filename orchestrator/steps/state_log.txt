        "The board game is played on a square grid, typically 8x8, where two players take turns to move their pieces. Each player starts with a set of pieces, which may include pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, a queen, and a king. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape. Players can move their pieces according to specific rules: pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, bishops move diagonally, rooks move vertically or horizontally, the queen can move in any direction, and the king moves one square in any direction. Players must also follow the rules of castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The game ends when one player checkmates the other, resigns, or a stalemate occurs.",
        "To implement a scoring system on a 1-step scale for the board game, assign a score of 1 point for each piece captured by a player. At the end of the game, tally the total points based on the number of pieces captured to determine the winner. If a player checkmates their opponent, they receive an additional bonus of 3 points.",
        "To create a loop that plays the game until a player reaches a score of 5, initialize a score variable for each player at 0. Use a while loop that continues as long as neither player's score is 5. Inside the loop, simulate a turn for each player where they make a move, and update their score based on the pieces captured during that turn. After each turn, check if either player's score has reached 5. If so, exit the loop and declare the player with the score of 5 as the winner.",
        "To check the score after each round in the board game, implement a scoring system where each player has a score variable initialized to zero. After each player's turn, update their score based on the pieces they have captured during that turn. Immediately after updating the score, check if either player's score has reached 5 points. If a player reaches this score, declare them as the winner and end the game. This process ensures that the score is monitored continuously throughout the game.",
        "To stop the game and output 'FINISH' once a player reaches a score of 5, implement a scoring check after each player's turn. If a player's score is updated to 5, immediately terminate the game loop and print 'FINISH' to indicate the end of the game.",

        "To implement the game logic for simulating turns for both players, create a loop that alternates between the two players. Each player will take a turn to make a move, which should include selecting a piece to move and determining the target square based on the movement rules of the piece. After each move, check if a piece has been captured and update the capturing player's score accordingly. If a player captures a piece, increment their score by 1 point. After each turn, check if either player's score has reached 5 points. If a player reaches this score, terminate the game loop and output 'FINISH' to indicate the end of the game. This ensures that the game logic captures pieces, updates scores, and checks for a winner after each turn.",
